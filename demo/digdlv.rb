#= NAME
#
#digdlv - Ruby script to perform DNS queries, validated against the ISC DLV
#registry.
#
#= SYNOPSIS
#
#digdlv name [ type [ class ] ]
#
#= DESCRIPTION
#
#Performs a DNS query on the given name.  The record type
#and class can also be specified; if left blank they default
#to A and IN.
#The program firstly loads the DLV zone signing key. Then, the
#requested DNS query is performed recursively. The response is then validated
#- the DLV registry is searched for the keys of the closest ancestor
#of the query name, and the chain of trust is followed to prove
#that the DNSSEC records are correct, or that we do not expect the
#response to be signed.
